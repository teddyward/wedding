            WHEN FRIENDS BECAME PARTNERS

        <div class="section-body">
            We met during orientation week as first-years at Duke
            in a name game where we introduced ourselves as “Terrible Teddy”
            and “Kaleidoscopic Kyrstin.” Over the next three years, our close
            friendship deepened into love, and in the summer of 2015 we shared
            our feelings with one another and have been entwined ever since.

            SHARED PROPOSAL

        <div class="section-body">
            We’d known for a long time that we would spend our lives together.
            On a sunny June afternoon, as warm light splashed over our San Francisco apartment,
            we held hands and asked each other when we’d be ready to get married.
            Teddy smiled and said, “I’m ready now. Will you marry me?” Kyrstin, teary-eyed,
            nodded and said, “Yes, will you marry me?” and Teddy replied, “Of course.”

            On a chilly day in May, we gathered our immediate families and said, “I do.”
            Draped in the purples and pinks of spring flowers, we celebrated our love with laughter,
            connection, and labradors
