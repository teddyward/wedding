            FRIENDS AT FIRST SIGHT
        </div>
        <div class="section-body">
            During first year orientation at Duke, we were placed in the same dorm
            and met during a name game as the summer sun was setting.
            We introduced ourselves as, “Terrible Teddy” and “Kaleidoscopic Kyrstin.”
            As instant friends, we would journey through Duke together,
            through the student living groups, contra dances, and games in the garden.

        <div class="section-body">
            Over the next three years, our close friendship deepened into love,
            and in the summer of 2015 we shared our feelings with one another
            from across different continents, over cups of Cocoa Cinnamon coffee,
            and in the waters of the Eno River. We’ve been entwined ever since.

            SHARED PROPOSAL

        <div class="section-body">
            We’d known for a long time that we would spend our lives together.
            On a sunny June afternoon, as warm light splashed over our San Francisco apartment,
            we held hands and asked each other to make it official, and to tie the knot.

            A SMALL CEREMONY
        </div>
        <div class="section-body">
            When the pandemic necessitated that we postpone our big wedding,
            we decided to gather our immediate families for an intimate wedding ceremony.
            So on a chilly May day in New York, draped in the purples and pinks of spring flowers,
            we said, “I do,” and celebrated our love with laughter, connection, and labradors.

            We are so excited to bring all of our loved ones together –
            friends and family alike – to be in community with one another,
            to share our joy, and to celebrate the next chapter of our lives together! 
            Our garden celebration will have toasts and games and contra dance.
            Can’t wait to see you in Durham!
