            Most of the event will be outdoors in a garden, and it's the south in late spring,
            so we're expecting weather in the high 70s! Dress accordingly: you don't need to wear a full suit.

        <div class="faq-question">
            Didn't y'all already get married?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            When we got engaged in 2019, we originally planned to have our wedding at
            the Museum of Life Science in May of 2021, but then postponed the party
            because of the pandemic. But we were just so excited to get married,
            so rather than have a 3-year engagement, we had a small wedding ceremony with immediate
            family in May 2021.<br>
            But! We still want to party with all of our loved ones, so we've planned this
            “celebration of marriage” for May 2022, on our 1 year anniversary.

            Why does this website say "not secure"?

            Teddy was extremely stubborn about building this website himself, but gave up
            with the SSL feature on Google Domains. Sorry.<br>
