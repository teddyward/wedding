            Didn’t y’all already get married?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            When we got engaged in 2019, we originally planned to have our wedding at
            the Museum of Life Science in May of 2021, but then postponed the party
            because of the pandemic. But we were just so excited to get married,
            so rather than have a 3-year engagement, we had a small wedding ceremony with immediate
            family in May 2021.<br>
            But! We still want to party with all of our loved ones, so we’ve planned this
            “celebration of marriage” for May 2022, on our 1 year anniversary.

        <div class="faq-question">
            What is Contra dancing, and why is that part of the wedding?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Contra dancing consists of couples dancing in long lines with pre-set steps
            to the tune of high-spirited traditional folk music. Throughout a song,
            each dancer will move “down the line” until they’ve danced a number of steps
            with each person in the line. This style of dancing has its roots in English, Scottish,
            and French traditional dancing and has been popularized in modern times in the US in
            New England and Appalachia. 
            <br>We have loved contra dancing throughout our friendship and life as a couple,
            and we think it is a great way to bring folks together!
            Still not sure about contra dancing? There will be a caller and a
            teaching session at the beginning of the dance to warm up.

            Teddy was extremely stubborn about building this website himself, but gave up
            with the SSL feature on Google Domains. Sorry.
