            Didn’t y’all already get married?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            When we got engaged in 2019, we originally planned to have our wedding at
            the Museum of Life Science in May of 2021, but then postponed the party
            because of the pandemic. But we were just so excited to get married,
            so rather than have a 3-year engagement, we had a small wedding ceremony with immediate
            family in May 2021.<br>
            But! We still want to party with all of our loved ones, so we’ve planned this
            “celebration of marriage” for May 2022, on our 1 year anniversary.

        <div class="faq-answer">
            You must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend the events.
            Any vaccine provider (JnJ, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, etc.) is acceptable.

            No need to get us a gift, in fact we prefer that you don’t.
            If you feel obliged to give something, please donate to our charity pool,
            which we will use to fund some of our favorite organizations, including:<br>

            Didn't this website used to have something about contra dancing?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Originally, we were considering doing contra dancing (line dancing)
            at our wedding, but due to rising COVID cases, decided that a type
            of dancing involving rapidly switching between random partners might
            not be the move. Instead, we will have a jazz band 
            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8LXVz2Mwe0">John Brown</a>).

            Why does this website say "not secure"?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Teddy was extremely stubborn about building this website himself, but gave up
            with the SSL feature on Google Domains. Sorry.<br>
            Your vaccination upload (via Google Forms) will still be secure.
