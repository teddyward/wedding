            Is there a dress code?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Semi-formal.<br>
            Most of the event will be outdoors in a garden; it's the south in late spring,
            and we're expecting weather in the high 70s! Dress accordingly: you don't need to wear a full suit. <strong>Dancing will be on the lawn</strong>, so don't bring heels if you don't want to go barefoot.

            What's your COVID policy?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            You must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend the events.
            Any vaccine provider (JnJ, Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, etc.) is acceptable.<br>
            If you have the opportunity, it would be fantastic to test before attending the wedding.
            We would <i>hope</i> it goes without saying, but if you do test positive, please don't come.
            We will see you when you get better :)

        <div class="faq-question">
            Didn't y'all already get married?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            When we got engaged in 2019, we originally planned to have our wedding at
            the Museum of Life Science in May of 2021, but then postponed the party
            because of the pandemic. But we were just so excited to get married,
            so we had a small wedding ceremony with immediate
            family in May 2021. We are so grateful that we had the opportunity to make it official
            with Bill and Jaci Lulow, before they passed.<br>
            But! We still want to party with all of our loved ones, because we love parties! So we've planned this
            “celebration of marriage” for May 2022, on our 1 year anniversary. It will probably feel a lot
            like any other wedding, but hopefully a wee bit more casual :)

            Contra dancing has been replaced with a vinyl DJ :sunglasses:

            Why does this website say "not secure"?

        <div class="faq-answer">
            Teddy was extremely stubborn about building this website himself, but gave up
            with the SSL feature on Google Domains. Sorry.<br>
