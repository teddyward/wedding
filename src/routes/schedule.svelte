            "PRE-GAME"<br>
            <i>Friday, 6:35PM</i>
        </div>
        <div class="section-body">
            Durham Bulls Athletic Park, 409 Blackwell Street, Durham<br>
            For anyone who is local or in town early, we have reserved a section
            to watch the AAA champions Durham Bulls - "famously" "profiled" in the Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon movie <i>Bull Durham</i> - as they play the Charlotte Knights.<br>
            Text Teddy (847 346 9673) if you'll be around, and he'll send you a ticket! You'll have to create a Durham Bulls account to access it, unfortunately, but then you can screenshot it or add it to an Apple wallet.<br>
            The ballpark is within walking distance of most places people are staying, but there's also parking at the American Tobacco Campus or the Corcoran Street Garage.
