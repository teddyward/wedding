            Durham Bulls Athletic Park<br>
            For anyone who is in town early, we have reserved boxes
            at the minor league stadium for the Durham Bulls - "famously" profiled in the Kevin Costner
            and Susan Sarandon movie <i>Bull Durham</i> - as they play the Charlotte Knights.<br>
            Message us if you'll be around, and we'll send you a ticket!

            We understand that this is somewhat unusual to start
            a wedding on the Saturday before a holiday (Memorial Day),
            but to help our many guests who have to travel,
            we've scheduled this event over a long weekend.
