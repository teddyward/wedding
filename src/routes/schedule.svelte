            For anyone who is in town early, we will have reserved space

            and Susan Sarandon movie <i>Bull Durham</i> - as they play the Charlotte Knights.

            We understand that this is somewhat unusual to start
            a wedding on the Saturday before a holiday (Memorial Day),
            but to help our many guests who have to travel,
            we’ve scheduled this event over a long weekend.
