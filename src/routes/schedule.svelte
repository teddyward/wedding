            Note that this is a Saturday (before memorial day). We understand that
            this is somewhat unusual, but to help our many guests who have to travel
            from the west coast, we scheduled this for a long weekend.
            We understand that many people may have other plans for
            their long weekend, but we hope to see you if you can make it.

            We are not having another ceremony - just a party to celebrate the one
            we already had.
